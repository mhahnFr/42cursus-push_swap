# Welcome to 42cursus-push_swap!
This repository contains a project of the [42 school]. The task of this
exercise is to sort a list of random numbers using two stacks and some given
instructions described below. The challenge is not only about sorting numbers
in general, but also to do so in an efficient way.

The possible instructions to do so are:
 - ``sa``: exchange the two elements on the top of the stack *A*.
 - ``sb``: exchange the two elements on the top of the stack *B*.
 - ``ss``: perform a swap on both stacks at the same time.
 - ``pa``: push the topmost element of the stack *A* to the top of stack *B*.
 - ``pb``: push the topmost element of the stack *B* to the top of stack *A*.
 - ``ra``: rotate the stack *A* in ascending order.
 - ``rra``: rotate the stack *A* in descending order.
 - ``rb``: rotate the st
